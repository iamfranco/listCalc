# ListCalc

This website is a calculator for performing element-wise operations on lists.

### Input entries and compute

1. A list can be manually created and modified by inputting entries. Press the `ENTER` key to move onto next entry.
2. Every list has a **black box** at the right that shows the **sum** of its entries.
3. Every list has a **reference alphabet** at the left.
4. A list can also be computed using a **formula**, such as `A * B`.

### Formula
A formula can contain:
  1. reference alphabets, such as (`A`, `B`, `C`),
  2. numerical operations, such as (`+`,`-`,`*`,`/`), and
  3. decimal numbers, such as (`1`, `3.14`, `-99.9`).

Numerical operations will be performed in an element-wise fashion.

### Plot list entries

Clicking on a list's **reference alphabet** will plot the list.
